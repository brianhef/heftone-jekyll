<b>[Verse 1]</b> 

G                    
Folks in Georgia's 'bout to go insane
Gdim
since that new dance down in Georgia came
Gdim
I'm the only person who's to blame
                            D7
I'm the party introduced it there so
G	
Give me credit to know a thing or two
Gdim
Give me credit for starting something new

I will show this little dance to you
                                 D7
When I do you'll say that it's a bear!
 
<b>[Chorus]</b>
G7
First You put your two knees close up tight
         C7
then you sway 'em to the left, sway 'em to the right
F7
step around the floor kinda nice and light
         Bb                             D7
then you twist around twist around with all your might
G7
Stretch your lovin' arms right out in space
         C7
then you do the Eagle Rock with style and grace
         Gdim              Bb       G7
put your foot right in and bring it back
C7                 F7          Bb
that's what I call Ballin' the Jack
 
<b>[Verse 2]</b>
It's being done in all the cabarets
all society now has got the craze
it's the best dance done in modern days
that is why I rave about it so
Play some good rag that will make you prance
Old folks young folks'll try to do the dance
Join right in now, while you've got the chance
Once again the steps to you I'll show
