<b>[Verse]</b>
D       A     D       A           D
Life is not a highway strewn with flowers
D        A       D      A        D
Still it holds a goodly share of bliss
F#m      C#7       F#m    C#7    F#m   B7   
When the sun gives way to April showers
Em                    E7               A   A7
Here's the point that you should never miss

<b>[Chorus]</b>
A                                  D          
Though April Showers may come your way
               A7                    D
They bring the flowers that bloom in May
           B7                Em
So if it's raining have no regrets
           E7
Because it isn't raining rain you know
     A7
It's raining violets
                                  D
And where you see clouds upon the hills
              B7                  Em B7 Em
You soon will see crowds of daffodils
           G             Gm
So keep on looking for a bluebird
    D                 B7
and listening for his song
    Em         A7            D
whenever April showers come along
