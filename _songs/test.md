<b>[Verse 1]</b>
Bm                                             F#     Bm
'Way --  down in the Jungle land Lived a happy chimpanzee,
A   E       A                                               F#
She loved a monkey --  with a long tail  -- mighty, how she loved him
Bm                                                       F#       Bm
Each -- night he would find her there -- Swinging in the coconut tree, And the
A                                         E7                 A7
monkey gay, at the break of day, Loved to hear the Chim -pie say:
 
<b>[Chorus 1]</b>
D                                          
Aba daba daba daba daba daba dab, Said the Chimpie to the Monk,
D                                            A7
Baba, daba daba daba daba daba dab, Said the Monkey to the Chimp.
A7                                  D
All night long they'd chatter away, All day long they were happy and gay,
E7                            A7
Swinging -  and singing - in their honky, tonkey way.
D                             
Aba daba daba, daba daba daba dab means Monk I love but you

Bm                                                      F#      Bm
You -- should have heard that band --  playing on their wedding day
A       E         A                                            F#
Each -- chimp and monkey -- had a nut shell -- mighty how they played 'em
Bm                                          F#      Bm
And now it is every night -- high-up-in-the cocanut tree
A                                                       E7               A7
Its the same old thing with the same old swing when the monk and chimpee say

<b>[Chorus 2]</b>

Aba daba daba daba daba daba dab, Said the Chimpie to the Monk,

Aba daba daba, daba daba daba dab means Monk I love but you

Baba daba dab in monkey talk means Chimp I love you too 
G                                 D
